1.  **Naming:** Use generic names (e.g., `Settings Cleanup`, `Chart Improvements`) until the item is promoted.

2.  **Categories:**
    - **Backlog** — Concrete tasks ready for implementation
    - **On Hold** — Paused work with existing code/design
    - **Future Ideas** — Brainstorming, needs design before implementation

3.  **Format:** Use the template below for new items.

#### [Planner] Multiple Heating Sources/Deferrable Loads

**Goal:** Support control for multiple distinct heating sources (e.g., HVAC + Water Heater + Floor Heating) independently. A simple switch per each source to enable/disable it, and then the planner will decide when to turn them on/off based on the optimization problem. We need parameter for the kW consumption of each source and time/kWh goal.

**Notes:** Currently limited to a single water heater channel.

#### [Learning] Per-Device Load Forecasting

**Goal:** Train per-device load models (EV, water heater) instead of aggregated forecasts. Enables the planner to predict per-device consumption patterns (e.g., Tesla charges faster than Leaf, upstairs heater runs more at night).

**Notes:** Currently `ev_charging_kwh` and `water_kwh` in `slot_observations` are aggregated across all devices. Per-device energy recording (added in multi-device-ev-chargers change) provides the data foundation. Requires extending Aurora/Reflex models to accept device ID as a feature, and per-device forecast output in the pipeline. Not blocking for multi-device scheduling — the planner uses real-time sensor state, not forecasts, for per-device decisions.

### 💡 Future Ideas (Brainstorming)

#### [EV] Multi-Day EV Charging Planning

**Goal:** Allow users to plan EV charging across multiple days (e.g., "charge by Friday" from Monday), taking advantage of price differences over several days rather than just the next 24–48h horizon.

**Notes:** Requires long-term price forecasting since Nordpool only publishes day-ahead prices (~13:00 for the following day). Candidate approach: a LightGBM model trained on weather (temperature, cloud cover), calendar features (weekday, season, holidays), and historical Nordpool prices to forecast 2–5 day price curves. Current `departure_time` field is recurring-daily only. Would need a date picker or "one-shot" mode alongside the recurring mode. Keep out of scope until long-term forecasting model exists.
