1.  **Naming:** Use generic names (e.g., `Settings Cleanup`, `Chart Improvements`) until the item is promoted.

2.  **Categories:**
    - **Backlog** — Concrete tasks ready for implementation
    - **On Hold** — Paused work with existing code/design
    - **Future Ideas** — Brainstorming, needs design before implementation

### [UI SETTINGS] Messy Water heater settings

**Goal:** Water heater settings now have arrays, but some config keys are not in the array format like the "Water Heater Setpoint" or "Water Heater Power" is duplicated in both the array and the single value.

**Notes:** Need to concider the whole page and make sure to migrate all to the array format in both UI and config.

### [DRAFT] Inverter Clipping Support

**Goal:** Correctly model DC vs AC inverter limits in the Kepler solver to prevent over-optimistic planning on high-PV systems.
**Context:** User has a 15kWp array but a 10kW (AC) / 12kW (DC-Input) inverter. Current model assumes all PV is available at the AC bus.

**Plan:**

#### Phase 1: Configuration & Schema [DRAFT]
* [ ] Add `inverter.max_pv_input_kw` (DC limit) and `inverter.max_ac_output_kw` (AC limit) to `config.default.yaml`.
* [ ] Deprecate/Migration: Map old `system.inverter.max_power_kw` to `max_ac_output_kw`.
* [ ] **USER VERIFICATION:** Confirm schema covers all hardware limits (Access Power vs Input Power).

#### Phase 2: Solver Logic (DC Bus) [DRAFT]
* [ ] **Kepler Model:** Introduce `pv_to_ac[t]` and `discharge_to_ac[t]` variables.
* [ ] **Constraint:** `pv_actual[t] + discharge_dc[t] == charge_dc[t] + ac_produced[t]`.
* [ ] **Constraint:** `ac_produced[t] <= inverter_ac_limit`.
* [ ] **Constraint:** `pv_actual[t] <= inverter_pv_dc_limit`.
* [ ] Verify with test case (15kW PV, 10kW AC, 12kW DC battery charge).

#### Phase 3: Input Pipeline [DRAFT]
* [ ] **Inputs:** Update `backend/core/forecasts.py` to optionally clip forecasts early (for heuristic simplicity) or pass through raw data.
* [ ] **UI:** Show "Clipped Solar" in the dashboard forecast chart.

#### [Planner] Multiple Heating Sources/Deferrable Loads

**Goal:** Support control for multiple distinct heating sources (e.g., HVAC + Water Heater + Floor Heating) independently. A simple switch per each source to enable/disable it, and then the planner will decide when to turn them on/off based on the optimization problem. We need parameter for the kW consumption of each source and time/kWh goal.

**Notes:** Currently limited to a single water heater channel.

---

#### [Config] Inverter Max Power Config Orphan

**Goal:** Wire `system.inverter.max_power_kw` to the planner/executor or remove if superseded.

**Notes:** Config key is defined but never used in code. Related to "Inverter Clipping Support" backlog item. Either implement the feature or remove the config key to avoid confusion.

### 💡 Future Ideas (Brainstorming)

#### [UI] Advisor Overhaul

**Goal:** Redesign and improve the Advisor feature to provide more actionable and reliable energy insights.

**Notes:** Current version is disabled/hidden as it needs a complete overhaul. Should integrate better with Kepler schedules and Aurora forecasts.
